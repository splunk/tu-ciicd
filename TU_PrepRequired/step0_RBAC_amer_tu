#  EVERY APP NEEDS REVIEW BY 
#  ALL SC_ADMIN
#  <stack>_<searchhead>_admin_<region>


####### DEFAULT ROLES Best Practices ########
[role_sc_admin]
Without strict governance, training, and communication, any of these users could impact eachother (ES, ADhoc)
ALL of these user with the sc_admin role have access to the same capabilites, which is super admin on Cloud. 

Best practices:
Keep a most 2-3 super admin sc_admin users with the default sc_admin role, break glass, new features, and the highest level of global changes.
These accounts have a very strict management process for use, e.g. check-in/check-out.

[role_<stack?>_<searchhead>_admin_<region>]
For the rest of the "admins" create a new role (lower) that does not inherit directly to sc_admin
[role_ <<searchhead>_admin_<region>]
 "<stack>_<searchhead>_admin_<region>" for each unit/region, DOES NOT inherit any default Splunk roles
Do NOT add the following capabilities, or allow access to them.
This lower "sc_admin" role should NOT have the following capabilities that default sc_admin role has

- this ROLE does NOT have the folling capabilities that default user role has
- schedule_rtsearch
- upload_lookup_files

KEEP 
- change_own_password
