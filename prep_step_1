# Step 1
# Install and Setup Splunk Enterprise, Standalone Local, with Dev/Test Licens

# Whether you plan to build apps for Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise
# you need a local installation of Splunk Enterprise for your development environment. 
# With Splunk Enterprise you have access to the file system, but you don't have direct access to these files when using Splunk Cloud Platform.

# You must have an Enterprise or Dev/Test License, because we need to use the SHC Deployer capability, appinspect, and package-toolkit

> Install Splunk Enterprise localy as usual


# Step 1.1 
# 
# https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/tutorials/module_validate/packageapp/

#Download the Splunk Packaging Toolkit from Downloads.
#Install the .tar.gz file in the same development environment as your app files, which is on the same computer as Splunk Enterprise .... or pip

# Step 1.2
# From the command line, go to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps

# Create our first initializing ES dev/prod apps here.
# ./DA-ESS-security-content-30-prod
# ./DA-ESS-security-content-10-dev

# Create our first initializing AD-Hoc app here
# ./anyappname-adhoc
