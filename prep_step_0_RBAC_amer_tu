https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities#Splunk_platform_capabilities
Because capabilities change frequently from release to release, not every capability that is available to the Splunk platform appears in this list. 
Apps and add-ons can add their own capabilities which also do not appear here. 
See the documentation for the app or add-on that you use to potentially get information on app- and add-on-specific capabilities.

#  EVERY APP NEEDS REVIEW BY ALL ADMINS


####### DEFAULT ROLES Best Practices ########
[role_sc_admin]
Without strict governance, training, and communication, any of these users could impact eachother (ES, ADhoc)
ALL of these user with the sc_admin role have access to the same capabilites, which is super admin on Cloud. 

Best practices:
Keep a most 2-3 super admin sc_admin users with the default sc_admin role, break glass, new features, and the highest level of global changes.
These accounts have a very strict management process for use, e.g. check-in/check-out.

For the rest of the "admins" create a new role (lower) that does not inherit directly to sc_admin
[role_ <<searchhead>_admin_<region>]
 "<stack>_<searchhead>_admin_<region>" for each unit/region, DOES NOT inherit any default Splunk roles
Do NOT add the following capabilities, or allow access to them.
This lower "sc_admin" role should NOT have the following capabilities that default sc_admin role has 
= acs_edit_federated_providers
- acs_edit_maintenance_windows
- acs_edit_outbound_ports
- acs_edit_private_connectivity
- acs_list_federated_providers
- acs_list_ip_allow_list
- acs_list_outbound_ports
= acs_list_private_connectivity
= change_authentication
- can_delete
- apps_restore
= change_audit
- delete_by_keyword
- dispatch_rest_to_indexers (not available in Cloud)
- dmc_deploy_apps
- dmc_manage_topology
- edit_authentication_extensions


###### TU RBAC Recomendations #########
[role_sc_admin]
- TU Cloud sc_admin has currently 32 in AMER, ## in Canada, and ## in Cibil
RECOMMEND 
- Create lower admin roles [role_ <<searchhead>_admin_<region>] by best practices

#[role_user]
user has 1039 users 
All of these users can see indexes=* by default

RECOMMEND 
- create "tu_amer_user_<region>" for each bunit/region, do NOT inherit any default Splunk roles

REMOVE
- this ROLE does NOT have the folling capabilities that default user role has
- schedule_rtsearch
- upload_lookup_files

KEEP 
- change_own_password

[role_power]
power has 13 users, but inherhits user.
More locked down than sc_admin in some waus 
RECOMMEND 
- create a "tu_amer_power_<region>" one for each bunit/region, do NOT inherit any default Splunk roles

REMOVE
- this ROLE does NOT have the folling capabilities that default user+power role has
- admin_all_objects
